In our diverse world, we encounter a staggering array of over 9000 bird species, some of which are exceedingly rare and challenging to identify. To address this challenge, we've devised a simple yet effective method for recognizing these bird species based on their distinctive features. Notably, visual recognition of birds through images is more intuitive for humans compared to audio recognition. Hence, we've harnessed the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a robust branch of machine learning renowned for its prowess in image processing.

This research paper introduces a CNN-based system designed for classifying bird species. To validate its effectiveness, we employed the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200-2011) dataset for both training and testing purposes. Leveraging the algorithm of similarity comparison, our system has demonstrated impressive real-world results. With this method, anyone can effortlessly ascertain the identity of a specific bird species they encounter, simplifying the process of bird identification.
